# Init script for Gremlin Server so it automatically starts/stops with the machine.
#
# To install:
# 1)  Add a symlink to this file in /etc/init.d/ under the name you'd like to see the service
#     For example, to name the service "gremlin-server":
#       ln -s /usr/local/packages/dynamodb-janusgraph010-storage-backend-1.0.0/bin/gremlin-server-service.sh /etc/init.d/gremlin-server
# 2a) If you're running RH: chkconfig --add gremlin-server
# 2b) If you're running Ubuntu: update-rc.d gremlin-server defaults
#
# You have to SET the Gremlin Server installation directory here:
SVR="/usr/local/packages/dynamodb-janusgraph-storage-backend-1.3.0"
SVR_LOG="/var/log/gremlin-server"
# Specify the user to run Gremlin Server as:
SVR_USER="ec2-user"
# JAVA_OPTIONS only gets used on start
JAVA_OPTIONS="-server -Xms128m -Xmx512m -Djanusgraph.logdir=$SVR_LOG"
export SDKMAN_DIR=/usr/local/sdkman
source /usr/local/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh
